# Lab 17: Web Scraping

The file scraper.py contains functions that either returns the count the number of passages on a wikipedia page that need citations, or returns a string of all the passages that need citations. These functions accept a url string to a wikipedia page.

The file test_scraper.py contains tests based on an example wikipedia webpage to ensure the expected values are returned by the two functions mentioned above.
